# this folder contains a python code for comparison of two CPRD Aurum codelists in CSV format. 

instructions from code:
# using CODEBROWSER save your code list as text file, open in excel and save as a CSV file after changing the SNOMED coloumn to a 'Id' and the descriptive terms file to 'term' (lowercase)
# now you can run the code after swapping out the file paths to where you desire
# you may have to edit the comaprison file columns to 'Id' and 'term' depending where you sourced it from
# the output_id file is the most useful in my work.

# you will need python installed and pandas package installed.

The V2 file was added 25/07/23 and when run the output file contains just the term and id and the file 2 ids are the unique ids lacking from your codelist 
(according to file1 being original codelist and file2 being comparator in this case)
